# FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification Projects

I'm thrilled to share my journey through completing all the certified Relational Database Projects from the [freeCodeCamp Relational Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/). These projects utilize **SQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and database management principles to solve real-world challenges while ensuring proper database design and normalization. In this repository, you'll find examples of the **5 projects** I've completed, which you can use as references or guides to tackle similar tasks in your own learning.

## Projects in this Repository

1. **Celestial Database**: A database containing tables for planets, moons, and other celestial bodies, demonstrating the creation of relational tables and querying data.
2. **World Cup Database**: A project focused on managing data for a fictional World Cup event, featuring queries for match results, team statistics, and more.
3. **Salon Appointment Scheduler**: A database-backed scheduling system for a salon, allowing customers to book appointments and manage schedules efficiently.
4. **Periodic Table Database**: A relational database containing information about chemical elements, showcasing advanced SQL queries and table relationships.
5. **Number Guessing Game**: A small database-driven game where data such as user guesses and attempts are stored and retrieved using SQL.

## Features

- **Relational Database Design**: Properly normalized tables with keys and relationships.
- **Efficient SQL Queries**: Complex queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: All projects are built using PostgreSQL.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Simulated use cases to apply database concepts in practical projects.
